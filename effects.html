        <h1>What populations does digital privacy affect the most?</h1>
        <h5 class="w3-padding-32">People are starting to realize how difficult it is for the average person to keep track of what sensitive information has been collected about them and who has access to it. The ways that information can be used, shared, monetized, combined, correlated and mined may potentially lead to unintended, or even catastrophic, consequences for an individualâ€™s personal and financial well-being as well as for society as a whole. Our digital privacy is at risk in unprecedented ways. Personal data can affect our reputations, it can be used to exercise control over us and in the wrong hands, it can cause great harm.
        </h5>
  
        <p class="w3-text-grey">Depending on the age and race of individuals, some people can be more prone to experiencing privacy violations. These groups are Americans over the age of 65, as well as, Black and Hispanic individuals that feel as though they have experienced more breaches in their data. Americans ages 65 and older are less likely than those ages 18 to 29 to feel they have control over who can access things like their physical location, purchases made both online and offline and their private conversations. In addition, Black Americans are more likely than white Americans to say they believe the government is tracking all or most of what they do online or on their cellphones. When it comes to identity-theft issues, black adults (20%) are roughly three times as likely as their Hispanic (7%) or white counterparts (6%) to say someone has taken over their social media or email account in the past year. Black Americans are also more likely than white and Hispanic adults to say someone attempted to open a line of credit or applied for a loan using their name in the past 12 months. At the same time, white adults also report feeling less control across several information types when compared with black and Hispanic adults.</p>
        <p class = "w3-text-grey">Due to the lack of resources and help these individuals have on digital privacy, has widened the gap of the digital divide, making it difficult for them to be informed and protect themselves. It is even more crucial in this day and age, with everything going online, to begin understanding where your information is going and what extra precautions are needed to protect you and your data from being shared. </p>

  <h3 class="w3-center">How do large tech companies prey on user data?</h3>
  <p class="w3-center w3-large">Every year, Electronic Frontier Foundation has a “Who has your back report” where they rank the companies that best protect your privacy online. A total of 26 tech giants who protect the users from governmental surveillance were involved in this ranking system. This ranking system is based on a five star system where each tech giant receives a star based on whether or not they fit the criteria. Out of the 26 companies involved, only 9 of them had a five star rating. Surprisingly, WhatsApp and Amazon had a 2 star rating and our major phone carries such as AT&T, verizon, and T-mobile all ranked in 1 star. Your user data is what is being stored in all these tech giants so these stars make a big difference to assess how reliable they are. These tech companies are making cyber attacking more likely with the amount of information that is being passed on.
    Some ways to protect yourselves from this is to make sure you know and have information on the tech companies involved with your businesses. The cyber securities are your best source of resource for protecting your information. But unfortunately not every cyber security business is as efficient as others and it all depends on how much you are willing to spend. 
    There are three main cybersecurity roles that are in demand: Cybersecurity Engineers, Security Architects, and Incident security responders.
    One thing to keep in mind is that an individual can only get as much protection as they can depending on how much money they are willing to put into protecting their information. This is what causes the digital divide in digital privacy. Not everyone has the luxury of opting for the best technologies in the digital world to protect themselves.

        <h1>How does the government steal our information?</h1>
        <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Authoritarian governments around the world are some of the worst offenders for tracking their citizen’s internet activity. If these governments are able to continue their privacy-invasive tracking, privacy on a global scale may remain a distant reality. Some amendments protect citizens’ privacy. for instance: the First Amendment protects the privacy of beliefs, the Third Amendment protects the privacy of the home against the use of it for housing soldiers, the Fourth Amendment protects privacy against unreasonable searches, the Fifth Amendment protects against self-incrimination, which in turn protects the personal information of privacy.</h5>
        
        <p class="w3-text-grey">However, those amendments only concern marriage, motherhood, and other family-related privacy. When it comes to digital privacy, US firms gather our data. Our internet information can be tracked by the government and many companies in many ways. They gather much data about the most intimate aspects of our lives. It includes our social security numbers, bank information, email messages, our communications, online searches, purchases, and much other sensitive information about us. When the government has easy access to our data, we lose more than just privacy and control over our data. We lose our free speech, security, and equality as well because the more the government has our information, the more they will have power over the citizens. For this reason, we want our privacy to be protected, and we should have a new federal law that protects citizens’ internet privacy.</p>

      <h3>Organized Crime</h3>
      <p>The way tech companies invade user privacy is through organized crime, where every step of it is meticulously formed by a hacker.</p>
      <p>The moment you click on the wrong button, it is close to impossible to determine how the user's information has been modified or stolen or how it is being used.</p>
      <p>It is integral to be constantly vigilant and research on a software before compromising your system and your information.</p>
      <p>Even with anti-virus software, it may be hard to detect malicious activity and it may not even be recognized. Your actions are the best form of privacy on the Internet.</p>

  <h3>Protecting Yourself</h3>
  <p class="w3-large">There are many ways to keep yourself safe from unwanted parties having access to your user data/personal information. Make sure to always secure your accounts because if you dont then hackers can easily leak your data to the public. Make sure to use a good, strong, and complex password for every account you use. This helps protect your security and privacy. Two-Step authentication is a really good way to get extra security on certain accounts. You put in your password along with a number that is generated on spot that is hard for hackers to access. </p>
  <p class="w3-large">Protect your web browsing: Every single thing that is done or seen online is tracked by companies and websites that you are using. Everything that you access online is stored and algorithms are used to formulate what type of things you like to watch, what your location is, and sometimes even your passwords gets hacked because many people nowadays save their passwords because they do not want memorize them and now your password is always saved in your web browser which makes twice as easy to access your information. </p>
  <p class="w3-large">uBlock Origin: This can be protected by browser extensions by block ad’s and the data you are using. If you combine uBlock with privacy badger, then this gives extra protection to block ad’s and block trackers, so that you don’t have to keep worrying about unwanted ad’s to keeping popping up. </p>
  <p class="w3-large">Use antivirus Software on your computer: it is in your best interest to setup an antivirus software for those who are prone to clicking pop up links or share there system with other people in their house so that you are less likely to viruses. Most computers run on windows 10 which have built in software systems such as windows defender. Mac OS users generally have a good software system that is built in to help them from unwanted virus and it is also possible to double your protection depending on your usages. Phones should have trusted apps installed in them rather than antivirus applications. </p>
  <p class="w3-large">Update your devices and software: Your computers and phones come with software updates from time to time to help increase your tablets security. Phones now have an automatic update setting to make sure that you are always protected from unwanted viruses and distractions. </p>
  <p class="w3-large">Do not install sketchy software: Make sure you always keep track of the where you are getting your information from. LIke pop-up websites or links can lead to a security breach in you tablet. This leads to tracking your location and leaking your data to the public. Make sure on your phones to always have your privacy turned on, do not download weird software or junk from pop up ads. Always get your software directly from the app stores. </p>
  <p class="w3-large">	Make sure that your tablets are protected even if they are lost or stolen: In case your phone is lost or stolen, you need to make sure that you have taken measures to lock your phone so that the unwanted party cannot access your information. This is best achieved by using a strong complex password, touch id, and  especially face id so that only you can unlock your phone. Also make sure to set up a remote tracking feature like find my iphone so that you can track your phones location when lost or stolen. </p>
